A note about the front end/back end connection.

We were able to extract output in the form of graphs that we would've liked to show as the output on our web app. We have what our ideal look was, BDADFrontEnd.html, but thinking it through, to have users click buttons, then make those lengthy calls to scala, isn't a grea user experience. So after expirementing with a python webapp (Flask), and the Play Framework for scala, we ended up not having a great representation of our front end. Ending with what we'd like our front end to look like, and concluding that all graphs should be preloaded, and merely displayed, rather than recalculated.
